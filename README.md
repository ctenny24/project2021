## Final Project for Cultural Heritage


Looking at the contemporary art collections in the Whitney Museum of Art, my project uses data visualization to analyze the quantification of their collections’ key variables: year, artwork, donor, and artist. Both datasets had more than 15 fields and over 20,000 rows that lessened to 15,000 after data cleaning. Their dataset can be found here:

Whitney Museum of Art: https://github.com/whitneymuseum/open-access 13 fields—focused on display_date, artists, and artworks 15,000 rows

The analysis was broken into two parts, using similar data cleaning processes in Python, yet different data visualization tools to narrate these relationships’ trends. Python was used for data cleaning, in which we went through a few rounds of data cleaning to isolate the right data needed to maneuver and identify the variables. Our data cleaning required: Isolating the initial display year for each artwork, filtering through the credit line for the donor names, then identifying the distinct count of artworks provided per donor, artists, and year.

I created packed bubbles and stacked bars in Tableau to visualize numeric similarities and differences between the variables in this collection. 

### My Process:

Create the different sheets:
+ Artworks vs Display Years
+ Artworks vs Artists
+ Donors vs Display Years
